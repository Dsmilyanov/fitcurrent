#*High Quality Code Teamwork Project*

Battle-Field-1 holds the original code **(DON'T MODIFY THIS)**
Battle-Field-1-Refactored holds the files to be refactored

Make sure to document every edit you make on a local .txt file. All .txt files will be merged together at the end of the project.

##*Deliverables*
The deliverables should contain the original code, the refactored code and the refactoring documentation.
